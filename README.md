# Smart City Scheduler: SCC and DAG Path Planner

This project implements a Java-based framework for planning and optimizing interdependent maintenance tasks in a **Smart City / Smart Campus** environment.  
It combines two major algorithmic topics — **Strongly Connected Components (SCC)** for cycle detection and **Shortest/Longest Path algorithms on DAGs** for optimal scheduling.

---

## Core Features

- **SCC Detection (Tarjan’s Algorithm)**: Detects cyclic dependencies between city tasks and compresses them into single components to ensure proper ordering.
- **Topological Sorting (Kahn’s Algorithm)**: Produces a valid linear order of independent tasks after SCC compression.
- **Shortest Path Analysis**: Computes minimal time between tasks in the acyclic (condensed) graph.
- **Longest Path (Critical Path)**: Identifies the sequence of dependent tasks that determine total project duration.
- **Instrumentation**: Integrated metrics system that measures execution time, DFS visits, relaxations, and queue operations.
- **Maven Build**: Clean, reproducible build process with JUnit tests and dataset-driven execution.

## Build and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** or higher  
- **Maven 3.6.0** or higher  

### 1. Clone and Build

```bash
mvn clean package
````

This command compiles all source files, runs tests, and creates a runnable JAR inside the `/target` directory.

### 2. Run the Application

Use the command line to launch the project and specify which dataset and graph to load.

```bash
java -jar target/smartcity-scheduler.jar --file data/small_graphs.json --graph S1
```

Other examples:

```bash
java -jar target/smartcity-scheduler.jar --file data/medium_graphs.json --graph M2
java -jar target/smartcity-scheduler.jar --file data/large_graphs.json --graph L3
```

### 3. Run Tests

Execute all JUnit test cases:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Dataset Summary

All input graphs are stored in the `/data` directory, divided into three categories: **small**, **medium**, and **large**.
Weights are **edge-based**, meaning each edge’s `w` represents time or cost between two dependent tasks.

| Dataset                      | Vertices | Edges | Structure            | Description                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ----- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `small_graphs.json` (S1–S3)  | 6–10     | 7–12  | 1–2 SCCs / Pure DAG  | Simple test cases, ideal for debugging |
| `medium_graphs.json` (M1–M3) | 10–20    | 15–25 | Mixed (several SCCs) | Realistic task dependencies            |
| `large_graphs.json` (L1–L3)  | 20–50    | 35–60 | Multiple SCCs        | Stress tests for performance timing    |

### 🔍 Analysis of Results

1. **Effect of SCCs on Complexity**
   Graphs with more SCCs show slightly higher operation counts, as condensation requires additional mapping.
   However, once compressed, DAG algorithms perform faster than on raw graphs.

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   SCC discovery (Tarjan’s algorithm) dominates runtime for dense graphs but remains O(V + E).
   Topological sorting and shortest/longest path computations are nearly constant in cost.

3. **Scalability**
   Even the largest datasets (≈50 vertices, ≈60 edges) complete under **3 milliseconds**,
   confirming linear scalability and efficient implementation.

## 📈 Performance Plots

### SCC Runtime vs Graph Size

![SCC Performance](plots/scc_time.png)

The runtime grows almost linearly with the number of vertices.
Dense graphs add a minor overhead due to deeper DFS recursion.

---

### Topological Sort and DAG Path Runtime

![Topo Performance](plots/topo_time.png)

Topological sorting and DAG dynamic programming remain consistently fast.
Both algorithms demonstrate O(V + E) scaling.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

* **When to Use**:
  The Smart City Scheduler is most effective for planning dependent operations with possible cyclic dependencies.

* **Practical Insights**:

    * For **pure DAGs**, the SCC step adds a negligible overhead but ensures safety.
    * For **cyclic graphs**, SCC compression is essential and makes the system tractable.
    * The **critical path** output provides planners with the sequence of operations that defines the project’s minimal duration.

* **Outcome**:
  This project demonstrates how to combine algorithmic efficiency with real-world applicability —
  detecting cycles, ordering tasks, and finding optimal paths within complex dependency networks.
